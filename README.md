This was a project completed during CodePath WEB 101 (Web Development) class.

The purpose of this website is to give information about a fictional Street Food Night Market event. It also contains an RSVP form with basic input validation. Users who submit this form with valid input will be added to the list of people who have RSVP'd, and the total count of people who have RSVP'd will update. After valid input is submitted, a modal with an animated image will pop up. This modal will automatically disappear after 7 seconds; however, the user can close it earlier if desired. The Reduce Motion button can be toggled to turn animation on or off for the modal image.
